        "The `price_contract` function calculates the value of a natural gas trading contract based on various input parameters. The function considers the costs associated with injecting, storing, and withdrawing natural gas, as well as the revenues generated from selling the gas.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`injection_dates` (list of str)**: List of dates when natural gas is injected into the storage facility. The dates should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n",
        "- **`withdrawal_dates` (list of str)**: List of dates when natural gas is withdrawn from the storage facility. The dates should be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.\n",
        "- **`prices` (dict)**: Dictionary where the keys are dates (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD') and the values are the prices of natural gas on those dates.\n",
        "- **`injection_rate` (float)**: The rate at which natural gas can be injected into the storage facility, in MMBtu.\n",
        "- **`withdrawal_rate` (float)**: The rate at which natural gas can be withdrawn from the storage facility, in MMBtu.\n",
        "- **`max_volume` (float)**: The maximum volume of natural gas that can be stored in the facility, in MMBtu.\n",
        "- **`storage_cost_per_month` (float)**: The monthly cost of storing natural gas, in dollars.\n",
        "- **`injection_withdrawal_cost_per_mmbtu` (float)**: The cost per MMBtu for injecting or withdrawing natural gas, in dollars.\n",
        "- **`transport_cost` (float)**: The cost of transporting natural gas to and from the storage facility, in dollars.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Returns\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`contract_value` (float)**: The calculated value of the natural gas trading contract, in dollars.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Date Conversion**: Convert the injection and withdrawal dates to datetime objects for easier manipulation.\n",
        "2. **Price DataFrame**: Create a DataFrame from the prices dictionary to facilitate lookup of prices by date.\n",
        "3. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize variables to keep track of total revenue, total cost, and current volume of natural gas in storage.\n",
        "4. **Calculate Injection Costs**:\n",
        "   - For each injection date, retrieve the price of natural gas.\n",
        "   - Calculate the volume of natural gas to be injected, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum storage volume.\n",
        "   - Update the current volume and calculate the injection cost, including the purchase cost and injection fee.\n",
        "   - Add the injection cost to the total cost.\n",
        "5. **Calculate Storage Costs**:\n",
        "   - Determine the number of months the natural gas will be stored.\n",
        "   - Calculate the total storage cost based on the monthly storage cost.\n",
        "   - Add the storage cost to the total cost.\n",
        "6. **Calculate Withdrawal Revenues**:\n",
        "   - For each withdrawal date, retrieve the price of natural gas.\n",
        "   - Calculate the volume of natural gas to be withdrawn, ensuring it does not exceed the current volume in storage.\n",
        "   - Update the current volume and calculate the withdrawal revenue, including the sale revenue and withdrawal fee.\n",
        "   - Add the withdrawal revenue to the total revenue.\n",
        "7. **Calculate Transport Costs**:\n",
        "   - Calculate the total transport cost, assuming it is incurred twice (to and from the facility).\n",
        "   - Add the transport cost to the total cost.\n",
        "8. **Calculate Contract Value**:\n",
        "   - Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to determine the value of the contract.\n",
        "   - Return the contract value."
